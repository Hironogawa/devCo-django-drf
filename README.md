# DevCo Django DRF

Django Rest Framework for Dev Course. We will use this repository to build a simple API that can be consumed by an frontend application.

## Steps

You will find for each step a branch with the code for that step. Also you'll find a folder with the name "tutorial" that contains the steps to follow and try for yourself.

### Step 1

To start with the tutorial, you need to setup your environment. With that basic setup you will have a Django project with all the necessary backages to start working, also you will have a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container. This setup is not limited to the Djnago Rest Framework, you can use it for any other Django project.
